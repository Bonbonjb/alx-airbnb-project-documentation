# Flowchart: User Registration Process

This flowchart illustrates the backend process for user registration in the ALX Airbnb clone project.

### Steps Visualized:
1. The user starts the registration process.
2. Fills out the registration form.
3. The system validates the user input.
4. If valid, the user data is saved to the database.
5. A confirmation email is sent to the user.
6. If invalid, an error message is shown.

This helps visualize the sequence and logic of one of the core backend functionalities.
