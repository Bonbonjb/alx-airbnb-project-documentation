# Data Flow Diagram

This directory contains the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone backend project.

The DFD illustrates how data moves through the system, covering key entities such as users, properties, bookings, and payments. It shows the interaction between external actors and backend processes, along with the flow of data into and out of databases.
